# Python Practice
Current objectives and practice plan for developing my python and data science skills.

# Motivation
Current projets are really too big and too new. Need to do some deliberate training/smaller projects so that can keep productive.

## Aims
- Write more pythonic code
- Write more code in VSCode rather than just jupyter notebooks
- Develop competences to ship flosp project

## Objectives
- Complete tutorials below and push relevant code to git
- Complete mini-project ideas

## Practice
- keep picking mini-projects just ahead of my skill level
- push small examples of code from tutorials whenever possible


#### Inspiration
* [Teach yourself to code in 10 years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)
* [similar repo](https://github.com/robert8138/python-deliberate-practice/blob/master/README.md)
